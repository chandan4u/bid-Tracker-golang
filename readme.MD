# Auction Bid Tracker

You have been asked with building part of a simple online auction system which will allow users to concurrently bid on items for sale. The system needs to be built in Go and/or Python.

Please, provide a bid-tracker interface and concrete implementation with the following functionality:

- record a userâ€™s bid on an item;
- get the current winning bid for an item;
- get all the bids for an item;
- get all the items on which a user has bid;
- build simple REST API to manage bids.

You are not required to implement a GUI (or CLI) or persistent store (events are for reporting only). You may use any appropriate libraries to help.

Test the performance of your solution.
